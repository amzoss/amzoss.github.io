# Personal Interests

## Music

I have performed in musical ensembles since I was very young. For many years, I was very active in marching ensembles, from high school and college marching bands to drum and bugle corps. One of the highlights of my musical career was competing with the [Star United Drum & Bugle Corps](https://www.facebook.com/starunitedcorps/), a group that has competed in the [Drum Corps Associates](https://dcacorps.org/) Mini-Corps Competition since 2006, placing first almost every year. I also performed with the Star of Indiana Alumni Corps for its 25th anniversary performance in 2010. Because of connections I formed in these and other marching groups, I spent several happy summers and falls working on the instructional staff for high school marching bands.

I am currently a member of the [Ambassadors Big Band](https://www.ambassadorsbigband.org/) of Chapel Hill, NC. In the past, I've also played with the [Durham Medical Orchestra](http://dmomusic.org/), where I also served as Communications Chair for several years. I have taken lessons and classes with the [Durham Jazz Workshop](https://www.durhamjazzworkshop.org/), and I hope to keep finding ways to grow as a musician.

## Sewing and Crafting

I learned how to use a sewing machine when I was quite young, and since the pandemic I've really enjoyed pursuing sewing projects as a creative outlet. My first major project in recent years was sewing custom fabric masks and table runners for my wedding in October 2020. I then transitioned to quilted, and I have made several bed-sized quilts, along with additional smaller projects like Christmas tree skirts and wall hangings.

One of my favorite sewing projects lately has been a quilted bread basket warmer in the shape of a chicken. My family had one growing up, and I've recently found a pattern that I like very well. I've even taken a couple of basket-making workshops to explore making both the bread basket and the quilted chicken.
