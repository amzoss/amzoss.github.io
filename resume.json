Each session builds on an assigned reading or viewing activity that should be completed before the session. Within the session, facilitators start with a short period of sharing topics and themes related to the session's pre-work. This is followed by small-group discussions, where attendees have a chance to reflect with and learn from each other.

In this paper, we seek to address this and other questions by applying an automated dictionary-based classification approach to the analysis of relevant research literature over time. We propose to examine the domain of mental health literature with an iterative workflow that combines large-scale data, an automated classifier, and visual analytics.

We describe Imprints, a system to enhance the role of visitor participation beyond information receiver to active creator of sense of place. Overall response to the Imprints system is explored through interviews and log analysis of use. Despite some usability issues, response to the system was positive, and it was appropriated for both personalization and awareness of others. The results suggest an opportunity to introduce technology that plays with the dynamic between private expression and public presence in the traditional environment of the art museum.","G":"<ul>\n<li>built Java drawing application to allow study participants to create custom avatars</li>\n<li>conducted observational research of system in use in the museum</li>\n<li>co-authored conference paper</li>\n<li>co-design poster</li>\n</ul>","H":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1056808.1056881"}],"Certification":[{"A":"pid","B":"certification"},{"A":"crt_3","B":"Carpentries Instructor, February 2021"},{"A":"crt_2","B":"RStudio Instructor - tidyverse, February 2021"},{"A":"crt_1","B":"Tableau Desktop Specialist, June 2019"}],"Tools":[{"A":"pid","B":"grouping","C":"tools_list"},{"A":"tool_1","B":"Data wrangling","C":"R, Tableau Prep Builder, Google Apps Script, Python, Knime, Open Refine, Ruby, bash scripting"},{"A":"tool_2","B":"Databases","C":"PostgreSQL, MySQL, Amazon Redshift, Airtable, Microsoft Access"},{"A":"tool_3","B":"Graphic design and layout","C":"Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, Inkscape, Swift Publisher"},{"A":"tool_4","B":"Statistical/data science software","C":"R, Python, JMP, Stata"},{"A":"tool_5","B":"Visualization","C":"Excel, Tableau, R/tidyverse, Google Data Studio, Plot.ly, Gephi, RAW, JMP"},{"A":"tool_6","B":"Web/CMS/Interface","C":"Wordpress, Drupal, R Shiny, Jekyll, Hugo, Wax, Bookdown, HTML/CSS/JavaScript"},{"A":"tool_7","B":"Project Management","C":"GitHub/GitLab, Basecamp, Atlassian Confluence/JIRA, AirTable, Agile/Scrum"}],"Awards":[{"A":"pid","B":"author","C":"year","D":"title","E":"description","F":"location","G":"award","H":"awd_url"},{"A":"awd_2","B":"Zoss, Angela M.","C":2021,"D":"2021 Florence Blakely Award","E":"Nominated for the Duke University Libraries 2021 Florence Blakely Award.
