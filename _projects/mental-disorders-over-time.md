Every decade brings changes in the perceptions of normal in mental health,
  as well as in how abnormal is labeled, understood, and dealt with. Neurosis, hysteria,
  and homosexuality are just a few examples of such changes. The shifts in terminology
  and classifications reflect our continuous struggle with social representations
  and treatment of the “other.” How could we best understand mental illness categorizations
  and become aware of their changes over time? In this paper, we seek to address this
  and other questions by applying an automated dictionary-based classification approach
  to the analysis of relevant research literature over time. We propose to examine
  the domain of mental health literature with an iterative workflow that combines
  large-scale data, an automated classifier, and visual analytics. We report on the
  early results of our analysis and discuss challenges and opportunities of using
  the workflow in domain analysis over time.
