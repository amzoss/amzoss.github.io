infrastructure.

## Responsibilities:

* Co-led [student team](https://codeplus.duke.edu/projects/phenom-population-growth-modeling-web-app-microbiologists) during 10-week summer data science experience, including daily stand-up meetings, weekly check-ins, and detailed mentorship on the design of web applications and data processing code
* Worked with team co-lead to determine appropriate training and code architecture strategies
* Advised students on visual components like process diagrams and the final poster
