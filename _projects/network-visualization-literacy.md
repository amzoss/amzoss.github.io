My dissertation research on network visualization literacy included an opinion
  survey to identify prominent issues in network visualization comprehension and a
  large-scale user study of the comprehension of network visualizations.

## Responsibilities:

* Surveyed 51 network science researchers to identify target visualization features
* Created a series of visualizations with systematic manipulations in numerical and graphical properties
* Constructed a series of quantitative network visualization analysis tasks
* Recruited hundreds of subjects to complete online test of network visualization comprehension
* Developed R scripts to process sample network datasets, conduct network statistics and clustering algorithms, generate test visualizations, process participant response data, apply mixed effects models, and visualize results
