  functionality and can be extended into other institutional areas.” -[folio.org](https://www.folio.org/)

Since joining the [Reporting Special Interest Group (SIG)](https://wiki.folio.org/display/RPT/) in September 2018, I have held progressively more advanced leadership roles. I am currently co-convener of the Reporting SIG and team lead for Resource Access/User Management query development.

## Responsibilities:

* generating test data
* writing PostgreSQL queries
* reviewing queries for logic and style
* creating and maintaining issues and documentation
* helping to maintain the GitHub repository
* developing and delivering training on reporting-related topics
* organizing SIG and development team meetings
* facilitating conversations with other FOLIO groups and community members
* advocating for resources for reporting functionality
