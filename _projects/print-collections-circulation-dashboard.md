Analyzing usage of print materials is important for collection development,
but the need for many years of data, and the plurality and variability of some data
attributes, makes analysis challenging. In a cooperative effort between Collection
Strategy and Development and Assessment and User Experience, Duke has developed
a tool for exploring circulation of printed books. The resulting Tableau visualization
allows high-level views and filtering by LC class, method of acquisition, year of
acquisition, and language. Filtered views also allow users to download more comprehensive
data for further analysis offline.
