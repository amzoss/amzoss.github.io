The cultural competence of an individual or team affects outcomes at work in
a myriad of ways; client interactions, team cohesion and collegiality, recruitment
and retention efforts, and institutional brand are all affected by our ability to
understand and to work with one another. Understanding how our identities interact
with our work environment and responsibilities is a key component of building cultural
competence. The You, Me, and IT series involves three separate 90-minute sessions
with an interested team or group. Each session builds on an assigned reading or
viewing activity that should be completed before the session. Within the session,
facilitators start with a short period of sharing topics and themes related to the
session's pre-work. This is followed by small-group discussions, where attendees
have a chance to reflect with and learn from each other. The focus of the sessions
is both on synthesizing the lessons from the pre-work and on applying these lessons
to IT culture and system/service design at Duke.

## Responsibilities:

* collaborate on design of series content
* deliver and facilitate discussion sessions
