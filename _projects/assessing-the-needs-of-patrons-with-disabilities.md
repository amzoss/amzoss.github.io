In 2021 and 2022, members of the Assessment Core Team (ACT) at Duke University
Libraries (DUL) led a study of users with apparent and non-apparent disabilities
to better understand their experiences in the Libraries and on campus, and identify
things the Libraries can change to increase the positive experiences that users
with disabilities have with library services, facilities, and materials. We designed
a multi-faceted study that included a literature review and environmental scan,
informational interviews with campus stakeholders, a user survey distributed to
the target population, and follow-up user interviews. This study is an extension
of the Librariesâ€™ 2020 user satisfaction survey, where we received some critical
feedback from users with disabilities. We designed this study to more fully understand
the experiences and needs of users with disabilities, as well as users who identify
as allies or caregivers to disabled individuals.
