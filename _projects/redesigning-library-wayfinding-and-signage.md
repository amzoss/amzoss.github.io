As a response to repeated feedback from patrons and staff about difficulties
navigating our library spaces, Duke University Libraries undertook a study to explore
patron wayfinding patterns. The study gathered data about patron wayfinding issues
by surveying library staff -- a recognition that small-scale observational studies
and self-reported concerns via patron surveys would result in only a small number
of the situations where patrons frequently have trouble with navigation. The survey
asked staff to report areas of our building where patrons typically find themselves
lost and what location they are trying to find. Results of this survey were synthesized
into an internal report making general recommendations about how to improve signage and wayfinding.

## Responsibilities:

* Design, conduct, and analyze staff survey
* Summarize survey results in internal reports
* Serve as project lead for implementation of suggestions
* Develop proposal for building improvements, including phased and tiered project options
* Offer advice on related local graphic design work
