A team submission to the Data Visualization Challenge for WebSci’14. Original
dataset of historical MEDLINE/PubMed article titles was enhanced with additional
metadata and parsed for references to diseases. Visualization received the Best
Student Award.

## Responsibilities:

* Developed python scripts to locate disease phrases in article titles
* Developed exploratory visualizations in a variety of tools to help the team narrow down to a particular narrative approach
* With continued feedback from team members, designed the submitted visualization using Raw Graphs, Wordle, and Adobe Illustrator.
