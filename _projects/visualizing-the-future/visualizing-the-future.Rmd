*A partnership between the University of Michigan, the University of Southern California, and Duke University, [Visualizing the Future](https://visualizingthefuture.github.io/) will gather current and aspiring specialists in data visualization to develop a literacy-based instructional and research agenda for library and information professionals. Taking cues from other projects and grants focused on general data and information literacy, the grant will fund a series of meetings, virtual conversations, and professional development opportunities to advance library-based data visualization instruction beyond hands-on, technology-based tutorials toward a nuanced, critical understanding of visualization as a research product and form of expression.*

This project was made possible in part by the [Institute of Museum and Library Services](https://www.imls.gov/), [RE-73-18-0059-18](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/re-73-18-0059-18).
