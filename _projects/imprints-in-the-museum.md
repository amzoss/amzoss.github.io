Personalization and social awareness, important aspects in the definition of
a place, are traditionally overlooked in the design of technology for museums. We
describe Imprints, a system to enhance the role of visitor participation beyond
information receiver to active creator of sense of place. Overall response to the
Imprints system is explored through interviews and log analysis of use. Despite
some usability issues, response to the system was positive, and it was appropriated
for both personalization and awareness of others. The results suggest an opportunity
to introduce technology that plays with the dynamic between private expression and
public presence in the traditional environment of the art museum.
