blurb: 'The Cultural Competence in Computing (3C) Fellows Program is a cohort-based
  professional development program that helps computing faculty, staff, postdoctoral
  researchers, graduate students, and professionals: 1) learn more about social science
  topics (such as identity, intersectionality, racism, bias, and discrimination) and
  how these topics impact computing environments (as well as the developed technologies);
  and 2) develop computing deliverables at their home institutions that leverage these
  topics to foster more inclusive and equitable cultures. I participated in the first
  cohort of the 3C Fellows program as a member of a team sponsored by Duke''s DiversifyIT
  group.'
