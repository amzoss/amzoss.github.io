A partnership between the University of Michigan, the University of Southern
California, and Duke University, [Visualizing the Future](https://visualizingthefuture.github.io/) will gather current and
aspiring specialists in data visualization to develop a literacy-based instructional
and research agenda for library and information professionals. Taking cues from
other projects and grants focused on general data and information literacy, the
grant will fund a series of meetings, virtual conversations, and professional development
opportunities to advance library-based data visualization instruction beyond hands-on,
technology-based tutorials toward a nuanced, critical understanding of visualization
as a research product and form of expression.
