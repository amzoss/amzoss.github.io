<p>Justin Joque (Universirty of Michigan), Andy Rutkowski (University of Southern California), and I applied for and were awarded a National Forum grant from IMLS to develop a literacy-based instructional and research agenda for data visualization in libraries.</p>
<p>The pandemic expanded our original two-year timeline to four years. During this time, we recruited a cohort of fellows, organized in-person and virtual gatherings, managed the award funds, submitted regular reports to IMLS, assessed progress toward goals, and pursued various projects in service of the mission of the grant.</p>

## Program Development and Management

responsible for managing the strategic direction and execution of the department’s
assessment program since December 2021.
* As the inaugural **Data Visualization Coordinator** in the (now) Center for Data and
Visualization Sciences, I conceived of and delivered a cohesive, comprehensive, and
creative data visualization service program. The program was so successful that a second
visualization consultant was approved after three years.
